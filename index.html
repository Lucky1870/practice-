             <p id=paragraph onclick="this.innerHTML='JESUS LOVES YOU'"> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
                 Awake to  righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God:  
                 speak this to your shame.
                 Abstain from things which contaminates (corrupts) your spirit 
                 Yes you might have received your salvation through Jesus Christ but does your lifestyle still honour him, have you refrained from the works which you claim were buried through baptism
                 Worldly things are enmity to God, things that pleases the flesh are contrary to what God wants </p>


          <h3 id=heading >1 Corinthians 15:50 </h3> 
              <p id=paragraph>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
                 Strive not to satiate the needs of the flesh but rather the spiritual being that stands a chance to inheritance in the kingdom of God
                 Preserve yourself from the situations and things which corrupt your salvation. </p>

          <h3 id=heading >1 Peter 1:23</h6>
               <p id=paragraph>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and  abideth for ever.
                  It is the spirit that is born of the incorruptible let not the desires of your flesh contaminate the seed of incorruption in you.</p>

          <h3 id=heading >1 Peter 3:4 </h3>
               <p id=paragraph>But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
